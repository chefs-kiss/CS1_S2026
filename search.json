To receive full credit for a progress check, you must check in with your instructor before leaving class on the day of the check.\nFinal Submission (30 pts): The final submission evaluates the overall quality of your project and presentation, based on the materials submitted prior to the final exam. Submissions are due the night before finals. A detailed grading rubric will be available on the project page.\nSmall group presentations (9 pts): During presentations, you will participate in three rounds of small-group presentations, presenting one-on-one with another project. Grading is based on the quality of your peer review during these rounds. The peer review form will be available on the project page.\nReflection (5 pts): Complete the reflection form up on the project page.

Missing class hinders your ability to achieve these important learning outcomes. That said, you understandably may need to occasionally miss class due to illness or a scheduling conflict. In these situations, I do not want to judge which absences should count as “excused” or “unexcused.” So, all absences will be treated equally, since they all result in missing important class time. Additionally, arriving late disrupts not only your own learning but also your classmates’ ability to engage fully in class activities. Any tardiness over 5 minutes (subject to instructor adjustment) will also be counted as an absence. During Jterm, each session (morning and afternoon) will have attendance taken, so missing an entire day of class equates to two absences.\nTo reflect the importance of attendance in this course: (1) If you have accrued two absences without contacting me in advance, I’ll notify your academic advisor and the Dean’s Office by filing an Early Alert Form to make sure you’re getting the support you need. (2) If you have accrued four absences (whether or not you contacted me in advance), you must meet with me to discuss your standing in the course and what you need to do to get back on track for successfully completing the class. (3) If you have accrued nine absences (whether or not you contacted me in advance), you’ll automatically fail the class. Nine absences means missing nearly a quarter of all class sessions, indicating that you have not legitimately completed a student-centered course that requires class engagement. If you do need to miss class, I strongly encourage you to check in with another student on what you missed, and attend office hours to discuss any questions that you have."
