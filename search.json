We’ll cover more specific applications in class.\nWorking with a Pandas DataFrame describes how to look at and access features and entries inside a pandas DataFrame.\nReading in data via read_csv aalks through different ways to grab data. We’ll mainly pull csvs from a url (often via git repo), so skim this one.\nData exploring walks through some of the basics of EDA (some of this may look familiar to code from previous PAs).\nData summarization walks through how to do some summarization and transformations common in data cleaning.\nAdditional Pandas content\nCheatsheets: numpy, pandas, reshaping, text data"

Remember to explain your answers.\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, you will use the titanic dataset \\(\\href{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic}{(see:https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)}\\). You may have to sign-in using your Google account to view the data. Use the train.csv dataset on the Data tab to inform your answers below. You can also find the csv here\n\nGive an example of a record. What does it represent? \nSuppose you are using this dataset to train a model that will use a passenger class, sex, age, and fare to predict whether or not they will survive. \n\nIs this a classification task or a regression task? Explain your answer. \nWhat are the features? Explain your answer. \nWhat are the targets? Explain your answer. \nWe call a model a null model if it predicts all observations (regardless of any features selected) as the target variable. For this dataset, the null model is a model that would label all records in our data as survived. What would be the accuracy of this null model’s predictions? \n\nWould you expect a model using passenger class, sex, age, and fare to predict whether or not a passenger would survive to give a better accuracy than the null model? Explain why or why not. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your own (non-technical) words, explain what each of the following summary statistics measures: \n\nmean:\nmedian:\nstandard deviation:\nmode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are given the following sets of five numbers, each with a mean and median of 3. \\[\n\\text{SetA: } \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} \\qquad\n\\text{SetB: } \\{3,3,3,3,3\\} \\qquad\n\\text{SetC: } \\{1,1,3,5,5\\}\n\\] For each of the examples below, give a brief explanation for each of the choices made.\n\nWhat is true about the sum of all numbers for each set? Which measure tells us why this is occurring? \n\nOrder the sets from smallest standard deviation to largest. Explain (non-technical, no math) why this is.\n\nCreate a set where the mean is 3, but the median is 4. Keep all numbers in the set between 0 and 5. \n\nDo part c again, but where the median is 0. Why must this set contain numbers higher than 5? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, you will use the titanic dataset to understand the relationships between different variables and draw meaningful conclusions using statistical tests. Your task is to use the given information to understand what each test is doing. You will then fill in the missing information for selecting a feature pair for each statistical test, forming hypotheses, and interpreting the results.\n\nt-test\n\nFeatures used:\nWhat the test is doing: It’s checking if the average age of survivors differs significantly from the average age of non-survivors\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)):\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)):\nHow to interpret this test:\nWhat to do if test is significant: If the result is significant, you could explore further by examining the age distribution for each group (survivors vs. non-survivors). You could create visualizations to check if the distribution is skewed or if there are specific age ranges that were more likely to survive.\n\nchi-square test\n\nFeatures used:\nWhat the test is doing:\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)):\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)): There is a significant association between passenger class and survival status\nHow to interpret this test:\nWhat to do if test is significant:\n\ncorrelation test\n\nFeatures used: age and fare\nWhat the test is doing:\nNull Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)):\nAlternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)):\nHow to interpret this test: If the p-value is small, you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between age and fare. If the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or -1, the relationship is strong, while a coefficient near 0 indicates no significant relationship.\nWhat to do if test is significant:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive an example of a set of five numbers with a mean of 3.

    "text": "Semester Project\n\n\nOverview\nYou may choose to work on any machine learning project of your choice. This could be similar to the types of regression, classification, or clustering that we will cover in class, or could be on machine learning related to text (things like sentiment analysis, or text generation), or could be on machine learning related to images (things like image recognition, or image generation), or another area of machine learning altogether.\nYou must choose to complete this project individually.\n\n\nRequirements\nThe first requirement for the project is that you have created a workflow plan for each section of the ML workflow process, and have code that implements that plan. There is a template up on Moodle for you to copy. You may make any changes you want to this template.\nYour workflow should have some form of data pre-processing, some kind of exploratory data analysis, training and testing of machine learning algorithms (including some parameter tuning), and evaluating the performance of your models.\nThe second requirement for the project is that it use one of the following datasets. These datasets cover a variety of topics and have enough records to build substantial models. If you wish, you may choose your own data set (both the UCI repo or data.world are good places to start) that is not on this list, but you’ll need to check with your instructor first.\n\nCardiotocography\nHuman Activity Recognition Using Smartphones\nLetter Recognition\nTurkiye Student Evaluation\nWine Quality\nBank Marketing Data Set\nContraceptive Method Choice Data Set\nCrimes in Chicago\nDefault of Credit Card Clients Data Set\nOnline Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset\nSynthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection (fake data set, but should still provide useful practice)\nRice Variety Recognition\nMice Protein Expression\n\n\n\nProject Check-ins\nThere are nine progress checks during the semester, each worth 4 points (see the schedule). To receive full credit for a progress check, you must check in with your instructor before leaving class on the day of the check.\n\nPC0\nFork project site and deploy via GitPages.  slides\n\n\nPC1\nIdentify three data sets that you’re interested in. If you include a data set not on the list above, you need to check with your instructor. Include links to each dataset.  slides\n\n\nPC2\nSelect one dataset and do some background research. Make sure your data is accessible on a git repo.\nDepending on your project, this might be as simple as locating a git repo that has your data set, or it might require you to upload the dataset to your personal git repo. Additionally, this could involve combining multiple data sources, or gathering data yourself. If your project requires you to gather your own data, please discuss this with your instructor before beginning, so that we can make sure you have a realistic plan to gather enough data.\nslides\n\n\nPC3\nPerform some exploratory data analysis. Discuss the results, and what this tells you about your data, as well as your expectations for your results. This should include some data visualizations that go beyond a basic chart.\n\n\nPC4\nTime to do some research. What is the goal of the model you plan to build? Has something similar been done with this type of data? Do a write up of background information, making sure to link sources.\n\n\nPC5\nPrepare your data set for training. This might include handling missing or categorical values, basic conversions, or more extensive conversions. Any choices that you make should be explained. Additionally, spend time making good visualizations.\n\n\nPC6\nPlan out your modeling workflow: what models would you like to use, what evaluation are you doing? Start building your presentation.\n\n\nPC7\nTrain models using machine learning algorithms. Although you do not need to use every algorithm that we’ve covered, you should use those that make sense for your data set. You should explain your choices, and perform parameter tuning in order to optimize their performance.Continue building presentation.\n\n\nPC8\nDiscussion of results. Compare the performance of your models, and discuss the results. Do you consider your results successful? Explain why or why not, and discuss how further improvements might be made.\nContinue working on your final presentation. You want a presentation that is digestible to a non-technical audidence and is interesting in some way (visualizations, insights, models, data).\n\n\nPC9\nEvaluation of your plan. Discuss how closely you were able to follow your workflow. What unexpected issues did you encounter? What adjustments did you need to make? How would this affect planning a future machine learning project? Finalize your presentation, and submit your link along with a screenshot to Moodle.\n\n\n\nFinal Submission\nThe final submission evaluates the overall quality of your project and presentation, based on the materials submitted prior to the final exam. Submissions are due the night before finals.\nA detailed grading rubric TBD\n\n\nSmall group presentations\n(12 pts): During presentations, you will participate in three rounds of small-group presentations, presenting one-on-one with another project. Grading is based on the quality of your peer review during these rounds.\nThe peer review form is available here",
