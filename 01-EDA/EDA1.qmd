## Warm-up: Describe this Data

Imagine you’ve just been this random sample of a dataset:
```{python}
#| echo: false
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Load the penguins dataset
penguins = sns.load_dataset('penguins')

# Display a sample of the data
penguins.sample(6, random_state=52)
```

We would like to unpack the stories that this data might tell. How many different ways can we describe or summarize this data—both its overall shape and its finer details?
